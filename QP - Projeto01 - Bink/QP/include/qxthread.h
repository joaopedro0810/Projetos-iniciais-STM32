* QXThread represents the eXtended (blocking) thread of the QXK preemptive
* kernel. Each extended thread in the application must be represented by
* the corresponding ::QXThread instance
*
* @note
* Typically, ::QXThread is instantiated directly in the application code.
* The customization of the thread occurs in the QXThread_ctor(), where you
* provide the thread-handler function as the parameter.

* @param[in,out] me_   pointer (see @ref oop)
* @param[in]     e_    pointer to the event to post
* @param[in]     margin_ the minimum free slots in the queue, which
*                      must still be available after posting the event.
*                      The special value #QF_NO_MARGIN causes asserting
*                      failure in case event allocation fails.
* @param[in]     sender_ pointer to the sender object (used in QS tracing)
*
* @returns
* 'true' if the posting succeeded, and 'false' if the posting failed due
* to insufficient margin of free slots available in the queue.
*
* @note
* The @p sender_ parameter is actually only used when QS tracing is enabled
* (macro #Q_SPY is defined). When QS software tracing is disabled, the
* QXTHREAD_POST_X() macro does not pass the @p sender_ argument, so the
* overhead of passing this extra argument is entirely avoided.
*
* @note
* The pointer to the sender object is not necessarily a pointer to an
* active object. In fact, if QXTHREAD_POST_X() is called from an interrupt
* or other context, you can create a unique object just to unambiguously
* identify the sender of the event.

/*! Blocking Mutex the QXK preemptive kernel
* @details
* ::QXMutex is a blocking mutual exclusion mechanism that can also apply
* the **priority ceiling protocol** to avoid unbounded priority inversion
* (if initialized with a non-zero ceiling priority, see QXMutex_init()).
* In that case, ::QXMutex requires its own uinque QP priority level, which
* cannot be used by any thread or any other ::QXMutex.
* If initialized with zero ceiling priority, ::QXMutex does **not** use the
* priority ceiling protocol and does not require a unique QP priority
* (see QXMutex_init()).
* ::QXMutex is **recursive** (reentrant), which means that it can be locked
* multiple times (up to 255 levels) by the *same* thread without causing
* deadlock.
* ::QXMutex is primarily intended for the @ref ::QXThread
* "extened (blocking) threads", but can also be used by the @ref ::QActive
* "basic threads" through the non-blocking QXMutex_tryLock() API.
*
* @note
* ::QXMutex should be used in situations when at least one of the extended
* threads contending for the mutex blocks while holding the mutex (between
* the QXMutex_lock() and QXMutex_unlock() operations). If no blocking is
* needed while holding the mutex, the more efficient non-blocking mechanism
* of @ref srs_qxk_schedLock() "selective QXK scheduler locking" should be used
* instead. @ref srs_qxk_schedLock() "Selective scheduler locking" is available
* for both @ref ::QActive "basic threads" and @ref ::QXThread "extended
* threads", so it is applicable to situations where resources are shared
* among all these threads.
